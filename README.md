# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to use collected data on students and schools within a district in order to present it to the school board. By turning the data into dataframes using the pandas library in python, the data is easy to organize and sort for the needs of this analysis.

This analysis includes the original goal of the school district analysis while replacing the Thomas High School ninth graders scores.

# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to use collected data on students and schools within a district in order to present it to the school board. By turning the data into dataframes using the pandas library in python, the data is easy to organize and sort for the needs of this analysis. That being said, the math and reading grades for ninth graders at Thomas High school have evidence of academic dishonesty and needed to be replaced. This analysis includes the original goal of the school district analysis while replacing the Thomas High School ninth graders scores. Replacing these scores means that the previous code may not work properly and changes had to be made.
